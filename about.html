		<h1>About us</h1>
			<p>We are a group of 4 engineers who saw a problem with todays traveling websites,<br>
			We meet up and decided to do something about it.<br>
			We worked for weeks, months, years, and we finally came up with a solution</p><br>

			<p>We call this solution the CultureHub, and we think that this is the answer.</p>

		<h2>Any issues?</h2>
