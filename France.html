				<p>Evidence of Cro-Magnons in France has also been found.  A taller Homo sapiens variety, Cro-Magnons are thought to have existed in the region approximately 35,000 years ago.  These early humans had larger brains than their ancestors, long and narrow skulls, and short, wide faces.  With much nimbler hands, Cro-Magnons were able to construct more advanced tools for hunting a number of species, including reindeer, bison, horses and mammoths.  They played music, danced and had fairly complicated social patterns.  Archaeological treasures from this period can still be seen today in the museums of Strasbourg.
				<br><br>	
				The Cro-Magnon people were also artists—primarily crude drawings that have helped archaeologists to somewhat piece together their history.  A tour of Grotte de Lascaux in France—a replica of the Lascaux cave where one of the world’s best examples of Cro-Magnon drawings were found in 1940—illustrates how early elemental drawings and etchings of animals gradually became more detailed and realistic. Nicknamed “Perigord’s Sistine Chapel,” the Lascaux cave is one of 25 known caves decorated in Dordogne’s Vezere Valley.
				<br><br>
				The Neolithic period, also known as the New Stone Age, also produced France’s incredible collection of menhirs and dolmens.  An ode to these megalithic monuments can be seen on the Morbihan Coast in Brittany.  During this era, warmer weather caused great changes in the natural flora and fauna, and saw the beginning of activities such as farming and raising stock.  Peas, beans, lentils and cereals were grown, and villages were settled.  Decorated pottery, woven fabrics and polished stone tools also became common household items.</p>
