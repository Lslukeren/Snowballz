		<h2>Brief history</h2>
		<p>About 55 BC Julius Caesar conquered the Roman province of Gaul. He made the Rhine the frontier of the new province. It was a natural defensive barrier. Later the Romans also chose the Danube as a frontier. They also created a ditch and earth bank with a wooden palisade on top from the Rhine to the Danube. In 9 AD the people who lived beyond the Rhine inflicted a crushing defeat on the Roman army in a battle at the Teutoberg Forest. The Romans lost about 20,000 men and their leader committed suicide. The battle ensured that the Romans never conquered Germany beyond the Rhine. However the Romans occupied southern and western Germany. They founded a number of towns which still survive (Augsburg, Cologne, Mainz, Regensburg and Trier). <br><br>

		In the late 5th century a Germanic people called the Franks carved out an empire in what is now France. (They gave the country its name). In 496 Clovis, the leader of the Franks became a Christian and his people followed. In 771 Charlemagne became king of the Franks. In 772 he attacked the Saxons. After a battle in 782 more than 4,000 Saxon captives were beheaded. Charlemagne also annexed Bavaria. In 800 he was crowned emperor. However Charlemagne's empire did not long survive his death. In 843 it was divided into three kingdoms, west, middle and east. In time the eastern kingdom, East Francia, was divided further into 5 duchies. In the early 10th century fierce Magyars from Eastern Europe attacked them.

		<h2>Some good to know german etiquette</h2>
		<p>Germans love hanshakes, so dont be afraid to throw your hand out there<br><br>
		If you have a meeting for a set time, meet up to that time. Being even a few minuets late is greatly offending<br><br>
		Throw your trash in the trashcans<br><br>
		Always knock on the door before entering<br><br>
		And if you want to be extra polite, adress everyone with their last name with "Sie"</p>
